<p>The root system is the descending (growing downwards) portion of the plant axis. When a seed germinates, radicle is the first organ to come out of it. It elongates to form primary or the tap root. It gives off lateral branches (secondary and tertiary roots) and thus forms the root system.</p>

<p>There are two types of roots they are,Tap root and Fibrous root.</p>
<h2>Tap root and Fibrous root</h3>
<p>Taproot penetrates deep into the soil, while a fibrous root is shallow and doesn't penetrate as deeply. A taproot is the differentiated essential root of the soil.The Fibrous root isn't the differentiated primary root of the plant.</p>
